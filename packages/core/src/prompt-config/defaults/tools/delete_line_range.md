- Use 'delete_line_range' to surgically remove blocks of code, such as an entire function or class.
- This is the preferred way to delete large blocks, as it avoids using a massive, brittle 'old_string' in the 'replace' tool.
- Always read the file or use 'get_file_outline' first to get the exact line numbers before deleting.
