URL: https://github.com/vybestack/llxprt-code/issues/466
Labels: good first issue, OK for Luther

Issue body:
----------------------------------------
references gemini, update it to current capabilities.

----------------------------------------

Repository branch: luther-issue466
Selection mode: auto

Requirements:
- Follow a strict test-first workflow: write or update tests before implementation.
- Limit work to resolving this issue; avoid touching unrelated areas.
- Leave git commits/pushes to the workflow; keep changes in the working tree.
- Reference the issue as #466 inside any summaries you produce.
- After making changes, run (locally) the same QA commands that the workflow will run:
  npm run format && npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test && npm run build
- Do not use web-search or web-fetch tools; stay within the repository context.
- Do not spawn subagents (e.g., /task or named profiles like 'joethecoder'); complete the work yourself in this session.
- Do not rely on local-only profiles or secrets that are unavailable in CI; assume only the data in this repository is accessible.
- Produce a final response summarizing changes and the tests you ran.

This is the first attempt for this run.

Focus on resolving the root cause, updating documentation/tests as needed, and ensuring the commands above pass.
