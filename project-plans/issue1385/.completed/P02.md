## Phase Information
- **Phase**: P02

- **Reviewer**: AI Assistant
- **Files Reviewed**: 9

## Quality Checklist Results

All files verified against:
- [x] Lines are numbered (e.g., "1:", "2:", etc.)
- [x] Interface contracts define INPUTS/OUTPUTS/DEPENDENCIES
- [x] Integration points reference specific files
- [x] Anti-pattern warnings use [ERROR] DO NOT / [OK] DO format
- [x] Algorithms match specification behavior
- [x] Error paths are defined

## Issues Found

### Minor Issues (No Action Required)

1. **resume-progress-overlay.md**: Only 9 numbered lines
   - **Status**: Acceptable - intentionally minimal component
   - **Reason**: File explicitly documents that complexity lives in `useSessionBrowser` and `performResume`, this component is just a visual indicator
   
2. **resume-command.md**: Lines 105-127 contain duplicate/alternative implementation notes
   - **Status**: Acceptable for pseudocode
   - **Reason**: Shows alternative implementation paths that were considered

### Pre-existing Codebase Issues (Unrelated to P02)

- TypeScript error in `packages/cli/src/utils/cleanup.ts`: `destroyAllPtys` does not exist on `ShellExecutionService`
- Lint errors in `scripts/tests/session-browser-e2e.test.js` (undefined globals)

These pre-existing issues are NOT related to the pseudocode being reviewed.

## Verdict: **PASS**

All 9 pseudocode files meet the quality standards required for Phase P02. The pseudocode provides:

1. **Clear Interface Contracts**: Each file defines inputs, outputs, and dependencies using TypeScript-style interfaces
2. **Integration Points**: Each file references specific line numbers and files where integration occurs
3. **Anti-Pattern Warnings**: Consistent use of [ERROR] DO NOT / [OK] DO format to prevent common mistakes
4. **Numbered Pseudocode**: All algorithm sections use numbered lines for precise reference
5. **Error Handling**: Error paths are explicitly defined in all applicable components

The pseudocode is ready for implementation in subsequent phases.

## Next Phase

Phase P03 (Test Specification) or direct implementation can proceed.
