## Verification Results

### Test File (PASS)
- Path: packages/cli/src/utils/__tests__/formatRelativeTime.spec.ts
- Exists: YES

### Test Count (PASS)
- Required: 25+
- Actual: 45
- Property tests: 7

### Test Categories Covered (PASS)
- Long mode (REQ-RT-001): All thresholds covered
- Short mode (REQ-RT-002): All abbreviated formats covered
- Future clamping (REQ-RT-003): Both modes tested
- Consistent now (REQ-RT-004): Default and explicit now tested

### Behavioral Testing Rules (PASS)
- Mock theater: NONE (no vi.spyOn/toHaveBeenCalled)
- Reverse testing: NONE
- Uses deterministic `now` parameter

### TDD Verification (PASS)
- Tests fail against stub: YES (stub returns '')
