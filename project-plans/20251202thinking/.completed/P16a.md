# Phase 16a Completion: Verify End-to-End Tests

## Status: PASS

## Verification Checklist

### Automated Checks
- [x] All 10 E2E tests pass
- [x] All 137 reasoning-related tests pass
- [x] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [x] No deferred implementation markers (TODO/FIXME/HACK/STUB/XXX)
- [x] No skipped tests (it.skip/test.skip/describe.skip)

### Semantic Verification

#### Behavioral Verification Questions
1. **Does each test verify a distinct requirement?**
   - [x] Scenario 1: REQ-THINK-003.1 (Streaming parsing)
   - [x] Scenario 2: REQ-THINK-003.2, REQ-THINK-003.3 (Non-streaming parsing, sourceField)
   - [x] Scenario 3: REQ-THINK-004.1, REQ-THINK-004.3 (includeInContext=true)
   - [x] Scenario 4: REQ-THINK-004.4 (includeInContext=false)
   - [x] Scenario 5: REQ-THINK-003.4 (Graceful absence)
   - [x] Scenario 7: EC-006 (Tool call + reasoning boundary)

2. **Are assertions specific, not generic?**
   - [x] Each test asserts on specific field values
   - [x] Tests verify correct block types and ordering
   - [x] Tests verify sourceField='reasoning_content'

3. **Would tests catch regression?**
   - [x] If parseStreamingReasoningDelta returned null, tests would fail
   - [x] If buildMessagesWithReasoning ignored settings, tests would fail
   - [x] If tool calls lost reasoning_content, tests would fail

4. **Is mock data realistic?**
   - [x] Mock streaming chunks match real OpenAI API format
   - [x] Mock non-streaming responses match real API format
   - [x] Tool call structures match real API format

### Integration Points Verified
- [x] Tests mock OpenAI API correctly
- [x] Tests use provider.generateChatCompletion() flow
- [x] Tests use provider.buildMessagesWithReasoning() with settings
- [x] Tests verify IContent block structure
