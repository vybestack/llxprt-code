# Phase 13: /key Commands Stub — COMPLETED

## Phase ID
`PLAN-20260211-SECURESTORE.P13`

## Completion Date
2026-02-11

## What Was Done
- Modified `packages/cli/src/ui/commands/keyCommand.ts` with subcommand parsing structure
- Added `SUBCOMMANDS` constant with `save`, `load`, `show`, `list`, `delete`
- Added handler function stubs for all 5 subcommands (return "not yet implemented" error)
- Added autocomplete stub (`getKeyCompletions`) returning empty array
- Preserved legacy behavior as fallback when first token doesn't match a subcommand
- Added `ProviderKeyStorage`, `getProviderKeyStorage`, `resetProviderKeyStorage`, `validateKeyName`, `KEY_NAME_REGEX` exports to `packages/core/src/index.ts`
- All plan markers present (`@plan PLAN-20260211-SECURESTORE.P13`)
- Case-sensitive subcommand matching (R12.5)
- Whitespace trimming before parsing (R12.6)

## Verification
- `npm run typecheck` — PASS
- Existing `keyCommand.test.ts` — 4/4 tests PASS (legacy behavior preserved)
