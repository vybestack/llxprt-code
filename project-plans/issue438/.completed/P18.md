# Phase P18 Validation Marker

Status: PASS

Evidence (2026-02-12):
- File exists: `packages/lsp/test/orchestrator.test.ts`
- Test/property ratio (plan formula):
  - `TEST_COUNT=32`
  - `PROP_COUNT=16`
  - `RATIO=50.00%` (>= 30% required)
- Forbidden pattern scan:
  - No matches for `NotYetImplemented`
  - No matches for `TODO|FIXME|HACK|STUB|XXX|TEMPORARY`
  - No matches for `skip|xit|xdescribe|.todo`
- Vitest execution:
  - Command: `cd packages/lsp && bunx vitest run test/orchestrator.test.ts`
  - Result: test suite fails with assertion failures (not compile/import errors)
  - Summary: `31 tests | 15 failed`, with explicit `AssertionError` and fast-check property failure due to assertion mismatch.

Failing assertion summary (natural red-path coverage on stub):
- Workspace root detection expected `/repo` but received `null`
- Dedup/start behavior expected `started=true` for first start, got `false`
- Partial-results timeout semantics mismatched (`timedOut` and result counts)
- Boundary allow-inside-root expected true, got false
- ANY/ALL known-file semantics expected true cases, got false
- Status expected configured/known/alphabetical server lists, got empty arrays
- Single-flight expected exactly one starter, got zero
- First-touch one-shot timeout expected first timeout then non-timeout, got mismatch
- Diagnostics freshness expected records with epoch > boundary, got empty
- Property-based first-touch one-shot property fails with counterexample
