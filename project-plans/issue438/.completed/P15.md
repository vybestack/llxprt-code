Phase: P15 (Server Registry implementation)

Evidence:
- Implemented real server registry behavior in packages/lsp/src/service/server-registry.ts.
- Built-ins include required ids: ts, eslint, gopls, python, rust with command/args/extensions/displayName.
- getBuiltinServers returns cloned deterministic entries.
- getServersForExtension supports expected mappings (.ts => ts + eslint, .go => gopls, unknown => empty).
- mergeUserConfig supports override, disable via empty command, and custom additions.
- createServerRegistry preserved and delegates to exported functions.
- Markers present:
  - @plan PLAN-20250212-LSP.P15
  - @pseudocode project-plans/issue438/pseudocode.md#phase-p15-server-registry-implementation
