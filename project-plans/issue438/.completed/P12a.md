# P12a Verification Marker

Verdict: PASS
Date: 2026-02-12

## Check 1
Command:
cd packages/lsp && bunx vitest run test/lsp-client.test.ts test/lsp-client-integration.test.ts

Result: PASS
Output:
- 2 test files passed
- 25 tests passed
- Exit code: 0

## Check 2
Command:
cd /Users/acoliver/projects/llxprt/branch-3/llxprt-code && git diff --name-only packages/lsp/test/lsp-client*.ts

Result: PASS
Output:
- No files listed (no diffs in targeted test files)
- Exit code: 0

## Check 3
Command:
grep deferred patterns in packages/lsp/src/service/lsp-client.ts
Executed as:
cd /Users/acoliver/projects/llxprt/branch-3/llxprt-code && grep -nE "TODO|FIXME|defer|deferred|later|not implemented|stub|placeholder" packages/lsp/src/service/lsp-client.ts || true

Result: PASS
Output:
- No matches

## Check 4
Command:
line count <= 800 for packages/lsp/src/service/lsp-client.ts
Executed as:
cd /Users/acoliver/projects/llxprt/branch-3/llxprt-code && wc -l packages/lsp/src/service/lsp-client.ts

Result: PASS
Output:
- 710 packages/lsp/src/service/lsp-client.ts

## Check 5
Command:
cd packages/lsp && bunx tsc --noEmit && bunx eslint src/service/lsp-client.ts

Result: PASS (with ESLint warning)
Output:
- TypeScript noEmit completed successfully
- ESLint exit code 0
- Warning: File ignored because no matching configuration was supplied

## Holistic Assessment
P12a implementation appears complete and stable against the verification scope. Unit and integration suites for lsp-client pass, including timing and edge-case diagnostics behavior, indicating the request/notification lifecycle and diagnostics wait flow are functioning as expected. No test edits were detected in the targeted lsp-client test files, deferred/placeholder patterns were not found in source, and file size remains within the required maintainability limit. Type-checking passes cleanly; lint command does not fail but reports configuration mismatch for direct file lint invocation, which is a tooling/configuration caveat rather than an implementation defect.

Overall status: PASS
