# P20 Completion Marker

Status: PASS

## Evidence
- File exists: `packages/lsp/src/channels/rpc-channel.ts`
- Plan marker present: `@plan:PLAN-20250212-LSP.P20`
- Required RPC methods registered:
  - `lsp/checkFile`
  - `lsp/diagnostics`
  - `lsp/status`
  - `lsp/shutdown`
- TypeScript compile check:
  - `cd packages/lsp && bunx tsc --noEmit` => PASS

## Notes
- `setupRpcChannel(connection: MessageConnection, orchestrator: Orchestrator): void` exported with typed request handlers.
- Stub phase preserved (minimal handler behavior with typed delegation).
