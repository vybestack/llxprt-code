# P09 Complete

Implemented `PLAN-20250212-LSP.P09` in `packages/lsp/src/service/lsp-client.ts`.

Evidence:
- Added required plan/pseudocode marker block for P09.
- Replaced prior stub interface/factory with typed `LspClient` class skeleton.
- Included required constructor and all required method signatures.
- Stub behavior matches phase requirements (NotYetImplemented throws or empty/null/no-op returns).
- No `any` types and no TODO/FIXME/HACK comments.
- File length is under 100 lines.
