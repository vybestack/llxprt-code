# P10 Completion Evidence

Phase: `PLAN-20250212-LSP.P10`

## Evidence
- Added `packages/lsp/test/lsp-client-integration.test.ts` with 8 active integration tests.
- Added plan/requirement/scenario markers to each integration test per plan style.
- Updated `packages/lsp/test/fixtures/fake-lsp-server.ts` to support:
  - initialize/initialized handshake
  - didOpen handling + publishDiagnostics
  - didChange handling + publishDiagnostics
  - delay mode (`--delay-ms`)
  - crash modes (`--crash-on-did-open`, `--crash-on-did-change`)
- Verified tests fail naturally on current `LspClient` stubs via `NotYetImplemented` behavior/assertion mismatch rather than import/compile errors.

## Scope Check
- P10 only.
- No P10a+ implementation performed.
