# P28 Completion Marker

Status: PASS (TDD RED)

## Deliverable
- Created integration TDD file:
  - `packages/core/src/lsp/__tests__/lsp-service-client-integration.test.ts`

## Coverage Summary
- Test count: 11 (`it(...)` blocks)
- Behavioral requirements covered:
  - REQ-GRACE-020 (bun missing -> graceful disable)
  - REQ-GRACE-030 (missing package -> graceful disable)
  - REQ-GRACE-040 (dead service -> empty results)
  - REQ-LIFE-050 (shutdown lifecycle)
  - REQ-LIFE-080 (no restart after crash/death)

## Quality/Compliance Checks
- Plan marker present: `@plan:PLAN-20250212-LSP.P28`
- No `NotYetImplemented` reverse-testing checks in test file
- Assertions count >= 10
- No TODO/FIXME/HACK, no skipped/todo tests, no trivial tautology assertions

## RED Evidence (expected for integration TDD phase)
Command:
- `cd packages/core && npx vitest run src/lsp/__tests__/lsp-service-client-integration.test.ts`

Observed result:
- 11 tests executed
- 4 failed / 7 passed
- Failures are assertion-based against current stub behavior (e.g., expected `isAlive()` true after start, expected non-null MCP streams when alive), which confirms natural RED phase behavior.
