# P24 Completion Marker

Status: PASS (TDD RED phase)

## Evidence
- Test file created:
  - `packages/lsp/test/mcp-channel.test.ts`
- Marker/tag presence in test file:
  - `@plan:PLAN-20250212-LSP.P24`
  - `@requirement REQ-NAV-010`
  - `@requirement REQ-NAV-030`
  - `@pseudocode mcp-channel.md lines 01-90`
- Test count and scope:
  - 12 active tests
  - Covers all 6 tools:
    - `lsp_goto_definition`
    - `lsp_find_references`
    - `lsp_hover`
    - `lsp_document_symbols`
    - `lsp_workspace_symbols`
    - `lsp_diagnostics`
  - Includes workspace-boundary and path-normalization expectations
- Compile check:
  - `cd packages/lsp && bunx tsc --noEmit` => PASS
- RED-phase execution:
  - `cd packages/lsp && bunx vitest run test/mcp-channel.test.ts` => FAIL
  - Failure mode is behavioral against current P23 stubs (stub text `MCP tool not implemented in this phase`), not syntax/import/harness API failure.

## Notes
- P24 intentionally remains RED to drive Phase P25 implementation.
