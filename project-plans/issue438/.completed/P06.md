# P06 Complete

- Added `packages/lsp/test/diagnostics-integration.test.ts` with 14 integration tests covering full diagnostics pipeline behavior.
- Included required markers: `@plan:PLAN-20250212-LSP.P06`, `@requirement`, `@scenario`, `@given`, `@when`, `@then` in each test block.
- Coverage includes REQ-FMT-010/020/030/040/050/055/060/065/066/067/068/080/090 and REQ-DIAG-070.
- Tests are written to fail naturally against current diagnostics stubs via concrete output assertions (no NotYetImplemented assertions, no mock theater).
- Scope limited to P06 artifacts only.
