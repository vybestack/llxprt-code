# Phase P18a Verification Complete

## Date
2025-02-12

## Verification Results

### CHECK 1: TEST_COUNT >= 15
**PASS** - Found 32 test cases (required: >=15)

### CHECK 2: Property-based test ratio >= 30%
**PASS** - Found 16 property-based tests (fc./prop), ratio: 50% (required: >=30%)

### CHECK 3: No NotYetImplemented
**PASS** - No NotYetImplemented markers found

### CHECK 4: No TODO/FIXME/HACK/skip markers
**PASS** - No deferred implementation patterns found

### CHECK 5: No trivial assertions
**PASS** - No placeholder assertions (expect(true).toBe(true), etc.)

### CHECK 6: Tests fail naturally on stubs
**PASS** - Vitest output shows 15 assertion failures with proper error messages:
- Property failed with counterexample
- AssertionError: expected false to be true
- No import/compile errors
- Tests fail due to stub behavior, not syntax issues

## Test Evidence
```
Test Files: 1
Tests: 15 failed | 16 passed (31 total)
Property-based: 16 (50%)
Duration: 261ms
```

## Verdict
**PASS** - All 6 verification checks passed

## Notes
- Tests properly fail on stub implementations with assertion errors
- No compile/import errors
- Strong property-based test coverage (50%)
- All tests are active (no skipped/todo)
- No placeholder/trivial assertions

## Phase Status
**COMPLETE** - Phase 18a verification successful
