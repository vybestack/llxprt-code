# REIMPLEMENT Plan: Hook Type Decoupling and Translation

**Upstream SHA:** `80673a0c0c11a69d3b3b60a5e8d8050459f0574d`  
**Subject:** feat(hooks): Hook Type Decoupling and Translation (#9078)

## Overview

This commit adds hook type translation functionality - part of the hooks system series.

## Files Changed (Upstream)

- `packages/core/src/hooks/hookTranslator.test.ts` (+236 lines - new)
- `packages/core/src/hooks/hookTranslator.ts` (+359 lines - new)

## LLxprt Considerations

1. **New Files** - These are new files, likely clean cherry-pick
2. **Dependencies** - Verify imports align with previous hook commits
3. **Multi-Provider** - Ensure hook translation works for all providers

## Implementation Steps

1. Verify `packages/core/src/hooks/` directory exists (created in Batch 14)
2. Cherry-pick the commit
3. Check for import path conflicts
4. Run tests

## Verification

```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck
npm run test --workspace @vybestack/llxprt-code-core -- hookTranslator
```

## Decision

- [x] Likely clean cherry-pick (new files)
- [ ] Manual adaptation needed

*Plan to be executed during Batch 16*
