# Phase 15a: Integration Verification — Completion Marker

Phase: P15a
Plan ID: PLAN-20250218-HOOKSYSTEM
Completed: 2026-02-18 17:20
Status: PASS

## Verification Results

| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Integration test file exists | YES |
| Test count | 16 (≥8 required) |
| Integration tests | PASS |
| Prior phase tests | PASS |
| Pre-existing tests | PASS |
| TypeScript | PASS |
| Build | PASS |
| Mock count | 0 (real components used) |
| Haiku test | PASS |

## Requirements Covered

- DELTA-HSYS-001: [OK]
- DELTA-HSYS-002: [OK]
- DELTA-HEVT-004: [OK]
- DELTA-HBUS-002: [OK]

## Gaps Verified

1. MessageBus integration: [OK] (round-trip test)
2. Payload validation: [OK] (invalid payload test)
3. Model translation: [OK] (fireBeforeModelEvent test)
4. Common-output processing: [OK] (ProcessedHookResult test)
5. Failure envelopes: [OK] (broken hook test)

## Reachability Proof

```
Entrypoint trace:
  Composition root:   packages/core/src/config/config.ts:2429 (new HookSystem(this))
  Caller:             packages/core/src/core/coreToolHookTriggers.ts (fire*Event calls)
  Hook execution:     packages/core/src/hooks/hookEventHandler.ts (executeHooksCore)
  Observed effect:    Haiku test passes, all integration tests pass
```

## Semantic Assessment

- Integration tests exercise REAL behavior (real MessageBus, real HookRegistry)
- Backward compatibility confirmed (pre-existing tests unchanged and passing)
- Feature is reachable from CLI entrypoint through Config.getHookSystem()
- All 5 original gaps demonstrably closed via integration tests

## Verdict: PASS

Ready for Phase 16 (E2E).
