   × MessageBus subscription (DELTA-HEVT-001) > subscribes and processes HOOK_EXECUTION_REQUEST
     → expected 0 to be greater than 0
   [OK] MessageBus subscription (DELTA-HEVT-001) > does NOT subscribe when MessageBus is absent
   [OK] MessageBus subscription (DELTA-HEVT-001) > ignores messages after dispose
   × Correlated responses (DELTA-HEVT-002) > response correlationId matches request
     → expected [] to have a length of 1 but got +0
   × Correlated responses (DELTA-HEVT-002) > successful execution produces success=true
     → expected [] to have a length of 1 but got +0
   × Correlated responses (DELTA-HEVT-002) > METAMORPHIC: correlationId echoed verbatim
     → Property failed: Counterexample: ["!"]
   × Unsupported event name (DELTA-HEVT-003) > unknown eventName produces failed response
     → expected [] to have a length of 1 but got +0
   × Unsupported event name (DELTA-HEVT-003) > failure response preserves correlationId
     → expected [] to have a length of 1 but got +0
   × Unsupported event name (DELTA-HEVT-003) > METAMORPHIC: invalid event name always produces success=false
     → Property failed: Counterexample: [" "," "]
   × Bus-absent fallback (DELTA-HBUS-002) > fireBeforeToolEvent works without MessageBus
     → Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'success')
   × Bus-absent fallback (DELTA-HBUS-002) > fireAfterToolEvent works without MessageBus
     → Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'success')
   × correlationId generation (DELTA-HBUS-003) > generates correlationId when missing
     → expected [] to have a length of 1 but got +0
   × correlationId generation (DELTA-HBUS-003) > generated correlationId matches UUID format
     → expected [] to have a length of 1 but got +0
   × correlationId generation (DELTA-HBUS-003) > METAMORPHIC: response always has non-empty correlationId
     → Property failed: Counterexample: ["BeforeTool"]
   [OK] Model translation (DELTA-HPAY-003) > fireBeforeModelEvent accepts model payload
   [OK] Model translation (DELTA-HPAY-003) > fireAfterModelEvent accepts model response
   × Model translation (DELTA-HPAY-003) > METAMORPHIC: exactly one response per request
     → Property failed: Counterexample: ["BeforeTool"," "]
```

Tests fail naturally - stub methods don't subscribe to bus or publish responses yet.
