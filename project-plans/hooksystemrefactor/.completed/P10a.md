# Phase 10a: Validation TDD Verification - Completion Marker

Phase: P10a
Plan: PLAN-20250218-HOOKSYSTEM
Completed: 2025-02-18
Verdict: PASS

## Verification Results

### Test Counts
- Unit tests (`it()`): 32 (exceeds 15 minimum)
- Property tests (`test.prop`): 6
- Property ratio: 6/38 total = 15.8%
- Behavioral assertions: 41 (`toBe(true)` or `toBe(false)`)

### Mock Theater Check
- `toHaveBeenCalled` count: 0
- Status: PASS (pure functions need no mocks)

### Event Family Coverage
All 8 event families covered:
- [x] BeforeTool
- [x] AfterTool
- [x] BeforeAgent
- [x] AfterAgent
- [x] BeforeModel
- [x] AfterModel
- [x] BeforeToolSelection
- [x] Notification

### Requirements Coverage
- [x] DELTA-HPAY-001: Runtime validation for all 8 event families
- [x] DELTA-HPAY-002: Validation failure prevents execution
- [x] DELTA-HPAY-005: Type predicates

### RED Phase Evidence
Tests fail with:
- 13 failed | 25 passed
- All failures are "expected false to be true" (validators return false for valid inputs)
- No NotYetImplemented errors
- Captured in P10.md completion marker

## Semantic Verification Checklist

### Test Reality Check
- [x] Tests assert REAL behavior (true/false returns)
- [x] Tests would FAIL if implementation returned constants
- [x] Tests verify observable outcomes, not internal details

### dev-docs/RULES.md Compliance
- [x] NO reverse testing
- [x] NO mock theater
- [x] Tests are BEHAVIORAL
- [x] Tests check actual return values

### Property Test Quality
- [x] METAMORPHIC invariants, not just "doesn't crash"
- [x] Constrained generators (no fc.object(), fc.anything())
- [x] Real domain entropy (non-empty strings, shaped records)

### RED Phase Evidence
- [x] Tests were run BEFORE implementation and FAILED
- [x] Failure output captured in .completed/P10.md
- [x] 13 tests expecting true received false

## Attestation

I attest that I have:
1. Read each test and verified it tests real behavior
2. Confirmed tests follow dev-docs/RULES.md (no reverse testing, no mock theater)
3. Verified RED phase failure evidence exists in P10.md
4. Confirmed tests would catch an empty/stub implementation

## Next Phase

P11: Implement validators to make the 13 failing tests pass.
