# Reimplement 8731309d — chore: do not retry the model request if the user has aborted the request (#11224)

Upstream: https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/commit/8731309d7c7c94375cfeefc7f76d75f11bc9716b
Areas: core
Rationale: Retry+abort handling differs; verify against llxprt retry flow

## Upstream Files
- `packages/core/src/core/geminiChat.ts` (exists: YES)
- `packages/core/src/utils/delay.test.ts` (exists: NO)
- `packages/core/src/utils/delay.ts` (exists: NO)
- `packages/core/src/utils/retry.test.ts` (exists: YES)
- `packages/core/src/utils/retry.ts` (exists: YES)

## Implementation Steps
1. Inspect upstream diff: `git show 8731309d --stat`.
2. Review each touched file: `git show 8731309d -- <file>`.
3. Apply equivalent changes in LLxprt, adjusting for:
   - Multi-provider architecture (no Google-only auth paths).
   - No Clearcut telemetry; keep llxprt logging model.
   - Canonical tool names and policy files per dev-docs/cherrypicking.md.
   - A2A server remains private.
4. If a referenced file is missing in LLxprt, document NO_OP in AUDIT.md and explain in NOTES.md.
5. Run quick verify after implementation: `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck`.
6. Commit with: `reimplement: chore: do not retry the model request if the user has aborted the request (#11224) (upstream 8731309d)`.
7. Update PROGRESS.md, append NOTES.md, and record in AUDIT.md.
