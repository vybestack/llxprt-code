# Batch 12 Audit (22f725eb)

## Intent
- Upstream adds queued message editing via Up Arrow, enabling users to pull queued messages back into the input buffer.

## Claimed Action
- PROGRESS.md marks Batch 12 as FULL/PICK for `22f725eb`.
- AUDIT.md marks Batch 12 as SKIP because LLxprt lacks queued message infrastructure (useMessageQueue, QueuedMessageDisplay), implying the feature was not applied.

## Code Evidence
- `packages/cli/src/ui/components/InputPrompt.tsx:77` declares `popAllMessages` prop for loading queued messages.
- `packages/cli/src/ui/components/InputPrompt.tsx:586` routes NAVIGATION_UP to input history with no queued-message editing logic.
- `packages/cli/src/ui/components/InputPrompt.test.tsx:2130` adds queued message editing test cases referencing `popAllMessages` and Up Arrow behavior.
- `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useMessageQueue.ts` is missing (no file).
- `packages/cli/src/ui/components/QueuedMessageDisplay.tsx` is missing (no file).

## Gaps/Mismatches
- PROGRESS.md claims a FULL/PICK, but AUDIT.md and code show the upstream feature is not present.
- The tests reference `popAllMessages`, but InputPrompt lacks implementation to call it on Up Arrow; the required hook/component infrastructure is absent.

## Verdict
partial
