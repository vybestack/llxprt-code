# Batch 21 Audit (Upstream `9b9ab609`)

## Planned
- Batch 21 is a REIMPLEMENT of upstream commit `9b9ab609`.
- Upstream subject: “feat(logging): Centralize debug logging with a dedicated utility (#11417)”.
- Intended change: add `packages/core/src/utils/debugLogger.ts` + test, and replace console logging in `KeypressContext.tsx` with the new utility.

Source: `project-plans/20260104gmerge/PLAN.md` (Batch 21 row).

## Reported
- AUDIT.md reports **Decision: REIMPLEMENT**, **Status: SKIP** for `9b9ab609`.
- Notes: LLxprt already has a superior DebugLogger system; upstream utility would be a downgrade.

Source: `project-plans/20260104gmerge/AUDIT.md` row for `9b9ab609`.

## Actual (Evidence)
- LLxprt has an existing, comprehensive DebugLogger implementation at `packages/core/src/debug/DebugLogger.ts` with namespace support, configuration integration, and file output.
- `KeypressContext.tsx` already uses DebugLogger (`const keypressLogger = new DebugLogger('llxprt:ui:keypress');`).
- The upstream utility files do **not** exist in LLxprt (`packages/core/src/utils/debugLogger.ts` and `packages/core/src/utils/debugLogger.test.ts` are absent).

Evidence:
- `packages/core/src/debug/DebugLogger.ts:1`
- `packages/cli/src/ui/contexts/KeypressContext.tsx:7`
- `packages/core/src/utils` directory listing has no `debugLogger.ts`.

## Gaps
- Plan expected a REIMPLEMENT; actual state is a deliberate SKIP because LLxprt already centralizes debug logging via a more advanced DebugLogger system.
- Upstream’s simple `utils/debugLogger` wrapper was not added (intentionally skipped).

## Confidence
High — direct file inspection confirms DebugLogger already exists and is used, and the upstream utility files are absent.
