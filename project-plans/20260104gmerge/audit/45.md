# Batch 45 Audit

## Planned
- Batch 45 was planned as a **PICK** of upstream SHAs: `16f5f767`, `ccf8d0ca`, `5b750f51`, `ed9f714f`, `306e12c2`.
  - Plan row: `project-plans/20260104gmerge/PLAN.md:168`

## Reported
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/AUDIT.md` indicates (from the table entries):
  - `16f5f767`: SKIP (already implemented / waitFor already used)
  - `ccf8d0ca`: SKIP (incompatible TestRig API)
  - `5b750f51`: SKIP (feature does not exist)
  - `ed9f714f`: SKIP (architectural divergence)
  - `306e12c2`: SKIP (already implemented)

## Actual (evidence)
- Partial evidence from AUDIT.md:
  - `16f5f767`: notes say `waitFor` already used in `packages/cli/src/ui/components/InputPrompt.test.tsx`.
  - `306e12c2`: notes say shift+tab regression already fixed as `b1fc76d88`.

## Gaps
- This report does not include direct file/line evidence for each SHA’s target area; it should be strengthened by verifying:
  - `InputPrompt.test.tsx` uses `waitFor` (for 16f5f767).
  - Ctrl+C integration test + TestRig API mismatch (ccf8d0ca).
  - Absence of Codebase Investigator feature (5b750f51).
  - Non-interactive MCP prompt command architecture (ed9f714f).
  - Shift+tab regression fix present (306e12c2).

## Confidence
- Medium. Based mainly on AUDIT.md claims with limited direct inspection.
