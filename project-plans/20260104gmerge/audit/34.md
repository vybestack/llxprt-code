# Batch 34 Audit

## Planned
- Batch 34 was planned as a **REIMPLEMENT** of upstream `36de6862`:
  - “Propagate traceId from code assist to response metadata”
  - Plan row: `project-plans/20260104gmerge/PLAN.md:157`
  - Playbook: `project-plans/20260104gmerge/36de6862-plan.md`

## Reported
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/AUDIT.md` lists `36de6862` as **VERIFIED** (dated 2026-01-06).

## Actual (evidence)
- Trace ID propagation is indicated as implemented and verified in the repo by the AUDIT.md entry.
- A full, direct code-level confirmation should locate:
  - Where code assist responses are received.
  - Where response metadata is constructed.
  - Where traceId is threaded through (types/response objects/logging).

## Gaps
- This report does not yet include direct file/line evidence (only the paperwork assertion).

## Confidence
- Medium. Paperwork says VERIFIED, but this writeup needs to be backed by direct code references.
