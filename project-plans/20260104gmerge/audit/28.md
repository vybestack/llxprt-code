# Batch 28 Audit — 98eef9ba

## Planned
- Reimplement upstream change 98eef9ba: update `web_fetch` tool definition text to instruct the model to provide a full, valid URL (http/https with hostname).
- Apply in LLxprt’s tool definition (`google_web_fetch`) since upstream file `web-fetch.ts` does not exist.
- Run full verification per batch (lint, typecheck, test, format, build, start).

## Reported
- AUDIT.md lists batch 28 as REIMPLEMENT and VERIFIED with local commit `4af93653d`.
- Notes indicate description text in `google-web-fetch.ts` is identical to upstream change and full verification passed (2026-01-06).

## Actual (evidence)
- Tool definition description for `google_web_fetch` explicitly requires full URLs with http/https and valid hostname: `packages/core/src/tools/google-web-fetch.ts:476` and `packages/core/src/tools/google-web-fetch.ts:481`.
- Parameter validation enforces at least one valid URL and reports malformed/unsupported URLs: `packages/core/src/tools/google-web-fetch.ts:499`.

## Gaps
- None found. Implementation matches the planned tool-definition update and includes enforcement via validation logic.

## Confidence
- High. The updated prompt description and validation rules in `packages/core/src/tools/google-web-fetch.ts` match the intended upstream behavior, and audit records state full verification passed.
