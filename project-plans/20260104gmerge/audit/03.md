# Batch 03 Audit

## Intent
Add `nargs: 1` to yargs single-argument options so positional prompts parse correctly (upstream `cfaa95a2`).

## Claimed Action
- PROGRESS.md says Batch 03 already implemented via commit `dcf347e21`, with `nargs: 1` on all single-argument options and positional prompt tests passing.
- AUDIT.md marks `cfaa95a2` as SKIP because it was already implemented.
- NOTES.md claims the change is NO_OP because `nargs: 1` is already present and upstream tests exist.

## Code Evidence
- `packages/cli/src/config/config.ts:311-316` shows `nargs: 1` only for the `extensions` option; no other options show `nargs` in this file.
- `packages/cli/src/config/config.test.ts:2641` and `packages/cli/src/config/config.test.ts:2658` include positional prompt tests with other flags.
- `packages/cli/src/config/config.test.ts:3128` and `packages/cli/src/config/config.test.ts:3167` include positional prompt parsing tests.

## Gaps/Mismatches
- The claimed broad application of `nargs: 1` to all single-argument options is not present in `config.ts`. Only `extensions` has `nargs: 1`.
- Tests for positional prompts exist, but the core change (adding `nargs: 1` to the affected options) is missing, so the batch’s intent is only partially met.

## Verdict
partial
