# Batch 10 Audit

## Intent
Batch 10 planned to apply three upstream changes: add folder names to the permissions dialog, improve deflake script isolation + unskip a test, and add an “Esc to close” hint in SettingsDialog.

## Claimed Action
From PROGRESS.md/AUDIT.md/NOTES.md: Batch 10 is marked as FULL/PICK and REIMPLEMENTED (commits `0e2efa699`, `bd104ab7a`, `a11d156aa`). Claims include:
- Permissions dialog shows folder names similar to launch dialog.
- Deflake script isolation improvements (temporary .dockerignore, env passing, args support) and unskipped test.
- SettingsDialog shows “Esc to close” hint with tests updated.

## Code Evidence
- Permissions dialog includes folder names in trust options: `packages/cli/src/ui/components/PermissionsModifyTrustDialog.tsx:66` and `packages/cli/src/ui/components/PermissionsModifyTrustDialog.tsx:71-77`.
- Deflake script uses temporary `.dockerignore`, env pass-through, args support: `scripts/deflake.js:19`, `scripts/deflake.js:35-39`, `scripts/deflake.js:71-118`.
- SettingsDialog hint text contains “Esc to close”: `packages/cli/src/ui/components/SettingsDialog.tsx:1246-1248`.
- SettingsDialog test asserts the hint text: `packages/cli/src/ui/components/SettingsDialog.test.tsx:226-231`.

## Gaps/Mismatches
- Notes/AUDIT claim changes in `TrustPermissionsDialog.tsx`, but the repo contains `PermissionsModifyTrustDialog.tsx` instead; no `TrustPermissionsDialog.tsx` exists.
- Notes/AUDIT claim deflake changes in `scripts/deflake.sh`, but the repo has `scripts/deflake.js` (no `.sh` file).
- Claimed “unskip test” for deflake is not evidenced; no deflake-related test file or unskipped deflake test was found in `integration-tests/`.

## Verdict
partial
