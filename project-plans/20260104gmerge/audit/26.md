# Audit Batch 26 (project-plans/20260104gmerge)

## Planned
- Reimplement upstream `f22aa72c` (“Making shell:true as default and adding -I to grep”) with local verification and documentation updates.

## Reported
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/AUDIT.md` row for `f22aa72c` marks **REIMPLEMENT** / **VERIFIED** with local commit `81be4bd89`, noting the change already existed in LLxprt and verification ran on 2026-01-06.

## Actual (evidence)
- Shell execution already defaults to `shell: true` on Windows and `shell: 'bash'` on other platforms in `packages/core/src/services/shellExecutionService.ts:171`.
- Grep fallback already includes `-I` in system grep args (`const grepArgs = ['-r', '-n', '-H', '-E', '-I'];`) in `packages/core/src/tools/grep.ts:690`.

## Gaps
- None identified; LLxprt already includes the functional behavior described by the upstream change.

## Confidence
- High — direct code inspection confirms both shell default behavior and grep `-I` flag are present.
