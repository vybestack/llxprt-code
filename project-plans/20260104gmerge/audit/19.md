# Batch 19 Audit

## Planned
- Batch 19 was planned as a **REIMPLEMENT** of upstream `08e87a59`:
  - “Log all user settings to enable measurement of experiment impacts”
  - Plan row: `project-plans/20260104gmerge/PLAN.md:142`
  - Playbook: `project-plans/20260104gmerge/08e87a59-plan.md`

## Reported
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/AUDIT.md` row for `08e87a59` is present but has **no Status/Local** recorded (blank), and the decision column is `REIMPLEMENT`.
- This means paperwork does not confirm it landed.

## Actual (evidence)
- **No Clearcut logger files exist in LLxprt** (consistent with non‑negotiables and the PLAN “file existence pre-check” list):
  - `packages/core/src/telemetry/clearcut-logger/clearcut-logger.ts` does not exist.
  - `packages/core/src/telemetry/clearcut-logger/clearcut-logger.test.ts` does not exist.
- **No repo-wide “log all user settings” mechanism is evident**:
  - The repo contains a large settings schema (`packages/cli/src/config/settingsSchema.ts`) and normal config plumbing, but there is no clearly named telemetry/metrics sink that records all settings.
  - Searching for obvious anchors such as “experiment impacts”, “log all user settings”, or similarly named collector/emitter does not turn up an implementation.

## Gaps
- The core intended capability (“log all user settings for experiment measurement”) is **not verified present**.
- AUDIT.md is missing a status/local commit reference for `08e87a59`.

## Confidence
- Medium. I can state confidently that Clearcut logger was not reintroduced (files absent). The absence of an implementation for “log all settings” is inferred from lack of identifiable code paths; if it was implemented under different naming, it may require a more targeted search anchored on the upstream diff.
