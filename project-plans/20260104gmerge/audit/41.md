# Batch 41 Audit (bf80263b)

## Planned
- Reimplement upstream `bf80263b` to add a message bus + policy engine integration across core/CLI/tooling, respecting LLxprt tool names and architecture per `project-plans/20260104gmerge/bf80263b-plan.md`.

## Reported
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/AUDIT.md` reports **VERIFIED** with Skip/NO_OP: LLxprt already has a message bus + policy engine, wired into `Config`, tools, and advanced features; applying upstream would regress functionality.

## Actual (evidence)
- Message bus implementation exists and integrates PolicyEngine decisions + tool confirmations in `packages/core/src/confirmation-bus/message-bus.ts:21`.
- Policy engine exists with rule evaluation, non-interactive handling, and MCP spoofing protection in `packages/core/src/policy/policy-engine.ts:8`.
- Config wires PolicyEngine + MessageBus and exposes getters used across runtime in `packages/core/src/config/config.ts:665` and `packages/core/src/config/config.ts:1036`.
- Integration tests cover message bus + policy engine + TOML policies in `packages/core/src/confirmation-bus/integration.test.ts:2`.

## Gaps
- None. LLxprt’s message bus + policy engine are present and more advanced than upstream (TOML policy loading, spoofing protection, bucket auth confirmation).

## Confidence
- High. Verified by direct code inspection of core MessageBus/PolicyEngine implementations, Config wiring, and integration tests.
