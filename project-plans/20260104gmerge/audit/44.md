# Batch 44 Audit — b364f376

## Planned
- Reimplement upstream `b364f376` to centralize console logging with `debugLogger` across a2a-server, cli, and core (full verification).
- Introduce a debug logger utility (upstream `packages/core/src/utils/debugLogger.ts`) and replace direct `console.*` calls with the utility.

## Reported
- `AUDIT.md` marks `b364f376` as VERIFIED with rationale that LLxprt already ships a superior `DebugLogger` system, so upstream’s thin wrapper is unnecessary.

## Actual (evidence)
- LLxprt already has a full-featured `DebugLogger` implementation with namespace filtering, log levels, redaction, and file output in `packages/core/src/debug/DebugLogger.ts:6`.
- The debug logger system is exported from the debug module (`packages/core/src/debug/index.ts:5`).
- LLxprt uses the `DebugLogger` class broadly (153 instantiations across core/cli/a2a-server), indicating centralized logging is already in place via the existing system.

## Gaps
- Upstream’s simple `packages/core/src/utils/debugLogger.ts` wrapper and the mass replacement of `console.*` calls were not added. This is effectively a NO_OP because LLxprt already provides a richer, configurable debug logging system and uses it across the codebase.

## Confidence
- High. Evidence shows the existing `DebugLogger` system is present and exported, matching (and exceeding) the upstream intent while making the upstream wrapper redundant.
