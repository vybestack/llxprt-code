# Batch 46 Audit

## Planned
- `c7243997`: Fix flaky `BaseSelectionList` scrolling tests by removing skip and stabilizing assertions.
- `2940b508`: Ignore benign PTY resize/scroll errors after PTY exit.
- `0d7da7ec`: Include URL path in MCP OAuth resource parameter.

## Reported
- `c7243997`: Marked SKIP as already implemented in LLxprt (AUDIT row 143).
- `2940b508`: Marked SKIP as incompatible architecture (AUDIT row 144).
- `0d7da7ec`: Marked SKIP as already implemented (AUDIT row 147).

## Actual (evidence)
- `c7243997`: `BaseSelectionList.test.tsx` already uses `waitFor()` in scrolling tests and is not skipped; the scrolling assertions are wrapped in `await waitFor()` in the suite (e.g., `packages/cli/src/ui/components/shared/BaseSelectionList.test.tsx:258`).
- `2940b508`: No `resizePty`/`scrollPty` API exists in `ShellExecutionService`; the class only exposes `execute()` and PTY setup happens during spawn (no resize method to patch), confirming the upstream fix is not applicable (`packages/core/src/services/shellExecutionService.ts:68`).
- `0d7da7ec`: `OAuthUtils.buildResourceParameter()` already returns `${protocol}//${host}${pathname}`, which includes the path, matching upstream intent (`packages/core/src/mcp/oauth-utils.ts:360`).

## Gaps
- None. Planned functionality is either already present (`c7243997`, `0d7da7ec`) or cannot apply due to missing APIs (`2940b508`).

## Confidence
- High. Direct code inspection confirms `c7243997` and `0d7da7ec`, and lack of PTY resize APIs confirms `2940b508` incompatibility.
