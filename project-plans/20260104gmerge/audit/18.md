# Batch 18 Audit

## Planned
- Batch 18 was planned as a PICK of `b4a405c6` (slash command description style cleanup) and `d3bdbc69` (add extension IDs) per `project-plans/20260104gmerge/PLAN.md:141`.

## Reported
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/PROGRESS.md:39` reports Batch 18 as: `b4a405c6` SKIP (cosmetic, LLxprt custom descriptions) and `d3bdbc69` SKIP-REIMPLEMENT (extension IDs valuable but conflicts with LLxprt flow).
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/AUDIT.md:87` and `project-plans/20260104gmerge/AUDIT.md:88` still list both items as Decision “PICK” with empty Status/Local fields.

## Actual (evidence)
- Slash command descriptions are unchanged and remain LLxprt-specific:
  - `packages/cli/src/ui/commands/extensionsCommand.ts:110` shows `description: 'List active extensions'`.
  - `packages/cli/src/ui/commands/extensionsCommand.ts:117` shows `description: 'Update extensions. Usage: update <extension-names>|--all'`.
  - `packages/cli/src/ui/commands/extensionsCommand.ts:137` shows `description: 'Manage extensions'`.
  These do not reflect a style cleanup consistent with upstream `b4a405c6`.
- Extension model lacks an ID field:
  - `packages/core/src/config/config.ts:179` defines `GeminiCLIExtension` without any `id`/`extensionId` field.
- Extension CLI output and uninstall logic do not reference IDs:
  - `packages/cli/src/config/extension.ts:689` selects the extension by name or install source only.
  - `packages/cli/src/config/extension.ts:722` formats output with name/version/path/source without any ID.

## Gaps
- `b4a405c6`: Slash command description style cleanup is not present.
- `d3bdbc69`: Extension IDs are not implemented in core model or CLI output/selection flow.
- Reported paperwork mismatch: PROGRESS marks SKIP/SKIP-REIMPLEMENT while AUDIT.md still shows PICK with empty Status/Local for both SHAs.

## Confidence
- High. Evidence directly inspects the relevant command descriptions, extension model interface, and CLI output paths.
