## Intent
Batch 16 aimed to port upstream UX/CLI fixes: add a short delay before Linux clipboard copy, suppress slash command execution/suggestions in shell mode, and add Esc-cancel hints to dialogs. Two additional commits were expected to be skipped due to PromptService and release system divergence.

## Claimed Action
From `project-plans/20260104gmerge/PROGRESS.md`: Batch 16 reports three picks applied (a5ebeada6 for 500ms Linux copy delay, f6d41e648 for shell-mode command suppression, 8b6f7643f for Esc hints), and two skips (0ded546a PromptService architecture, 4a0fcd05 release system differences).

## Code Evidence
- Shell mode suppresses slash command execution in `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useGeminiStream.ts:496` (slash handling wrapped in `if (!shellModeActive)`), and still handles shell commands when active at `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useGeminiStream.ts:538`.
- Slash command suggestions are disabled in shell mode in `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useCommandCompletion.tsx:168-176`.
- Esc hints are present in dialogs:
  - `packages/cli/src/ui/components/EditorSettingsDialog.tsx:155-158` (“Esc to close”).
  - `packages/cli/src/ui/components/ThemeDialog.tsx:320-324` (“Esc to close”).
  - `packages/cli/src/ui/components/PermissionsModifyTrustDialog.tsx:179-182` (“Esc to continue without restart.”) and `packages/cli/src/ui/components/PermissionsModifyTrustDialog.tsx:226-227` (“Escape to cancel”).
- Clipboard copy implementation does not include a Linux delay in `packages/cli/src/ui/utils/commandUtils.ts:46-145` (direct `spawn` calls for `xclip`/`xsel` without delay) and `packages/core/src/services/ClipboardService.ts:21-70` (direct `run` without delay).

## Gaps/Mismatches
- No evidence of the claimed 500ms Linux copy delay in clipboard utilities; both CLI and core clipboard implementations call clipboard commands immediately. This does not match the reported a5ebeada6 change.
- Shell-mode suppression and Esc hints are present and align with the claimed f6d41e648 and 8b6f7643f picks.

## Verdict
partial
