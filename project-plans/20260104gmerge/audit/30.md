# Batch 30 Audit

## Planned
- Batch 30 was planned as a **PICK** of upstream `0fd9ff0f`:
  - “Fix type errors in UI hooks tests”
  - Plan row: `project-plans/20260104gmerge/PLAN.md:153`

## Reported
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/AUDIT.md` row for `0fd9ff0f` exists with Decision `PICK` but has **no Status/Local** recorded (blank), indicating it was not completed (or paperwork wasn’t updated).

## Actual (evidence)
- Not verified as landed.
- Related area is “UI hooks tests”; LLxprt already has some exclusions for UI test typechecking (see other batch audits e.g. batches 20/23/25 referencing `packages/cli/tsconfig.json` excludes). This increases likelihood that the upstream fix was not directly applied.

## Gaps
- Cannot confirm any code or test changes corresponding to upstream `0fd9ff0f`.
- Paperwork missing: AUDIT.md should record SKIP/NO_OP/REIMPLEMENTED/COMMITTED with local hash if applicable.

## Confidence
- Low-medium. Based on missing AUDIT status and surrounding known test-typecheck divergence, it is likely not applied, but this report does not yet include pinpointed code evidence.
