# Batch 06 Audit

## Intent
Apply Batch 06 full pick of upstream commits `60420e52`, `a9083b9d`, and `b734723d` (directory autocomplete trailing space fix, show extension name in MCP list, update extension install warning).

## Claimed Action
- `60420e52` cherry-picked as commit `c527c3ecf` for directory autocomplete trailing space fix.
- `a9083b9d` marked NO_OP because MCP list already includes extension name.
- `b734723d` marked SKIP because LLxprt uses different extension warning text and has no `--consent` flow.

## Code Evidence
- Directory autocomplete avoids trailing space after path endings: `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useCommandCompletion.tsx:236`.
- MCP list includes extension name in server display: `packages/cli/src/ui/commands/mcpCommand.ts:162`.
- Extension install warning text present (LLxprt branding): `packages/cli/src/config/extension.ts:582`.

## Gaps/Mismatches
- Original batch intent was FULL PICK of three commits, but only `60420e52` landed; `a9083b9d` was already present and `b734723d` was not applied (no `--consent` flag or updated warning constant). This is documented as NO_OP/SKIP but remains a deviation from the original “FULL PICK” intent.

## Verdict
partial
