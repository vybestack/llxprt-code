# Batch 14 Audit

## Intent
- Upstream 406f0baa: fix keyboard input hangs by flushing incomplete kitty protocol sequences via a timeout and interrupt handlers.
- Upstream d42da871: allow line wrapping in screen reader mode by only disabling line wrapping when screen reader is off.

## Claimed Action
- PROGRESS.md marks Batch 14 as FULL SKIP because LLxprt already has kitty timeout handling and uses a different line wrapping approach for screen reader mode.
- NOTES.md (batch14-notes) reiterates the skip: kitty timeout already implemented; line-wrap escape sequence not used in LLxprt.

## Code Evidence
- `packages/cli/src/ui/contexts/KeypressContext.tsx:62` defines `KITTY_SEQUENCE_TIMEOUT_MS = 50`.
- `packages/cli/src/ui/contexts/KeypressContext.tsx:862` sets a timeout to flush incomplete kitty sequences using `KITTY_SEQUENCE_TIMEOUT_MS`.
- `packages/cli/src/ui/contexts/KeypressContext.tsx:580` flushes buffered kitty sequences on focus/paste interrupts.
- `packages/cli/src/ui/inkRenderOptions.ts:30` uses `config.getScreenReader()` and passes `isScreenReaderEnabled` into Ink render options.
- `packages/cli/src/ui/inkRenderOptions.ts:31` disables the alternate buffer when screen reader mode is enabled (Ink-native approach).

## Gaps/Mismatches
- d42da871 changes `gemini.tsx` to gate `\x1b[?7l` line-wrap disabling; LLxprt does not emit `\x1b[?7l` anywhere in `packages/cli/src`, so the upstream fix is inapplicable. Screen reader handling is implemented via Ink render options instead.
- 406f0baa’s kitty timeout handling is already present, so a skip is appropriate and consistent with the code.

## Verdict
