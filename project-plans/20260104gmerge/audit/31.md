# Batch 31 Audit

## Planned
- Upstream `c8518d6a` (Batch 31) moves tool name literals into `tool-names.ts` so config/agents/tools reference centralized constants.

## Reported
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/PROGRESS.md` marks Batch 31 as SKIP + VERIFIED, claiming tool names already centralized with better architecture.
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/AUDIT.md` row for `c8518d6a` says the change is already implemented and verified.

## Actual (evidence)
- Centralized constants exist in `packages/core/src/tools/tool-names.ts:16` through `packages/core/src/tools/tool-names.ts:57`, including aliases for `EDIT_TOOL_NAME`, `GREP_TOOL_NAME`, `READ_FILE_TOOL_NAME`, and `READ_MANY_FILES_TOOL_NAME`.
- `EditTool` uses the centralized constant: `packages/core/src/tools/edit.ts:691` (`static readonly Name = EDIT_TOOL_NAME`).
- Other tool classes still hardcode tool names instead of importing constants, e.g. `packages/core/src/tools/grep.ts:895` (`static readonly Name = 'search_file_content'`) and `packages/core/src/tools/read-file.ts:296` (`static readonly Name: string = 'read_file'`).
- CLI config still uses literal tool names instead of centralized constants, e.g. `READ_ONLY_TOOL_NAMES` and `EDIT_TOOL_NAME` literals in `packages/cli/src/config/config.ts:73` and `packages/cli/src/config/config.ts:88`.

## Gaps
- Centralization is partial: tool-name constants exist but are not consistently used across tools and CLI config. This does not fully satisfy the upstream intent to move all tool names into `tool-names.ts` and remove scattered literals.

## Confidence
- Medium: Evidence shows the constants exist, but multiple tool classes and config still use literals, indicating incomplete adoption.
