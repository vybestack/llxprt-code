# Batch 37 Audit (cc7e1472)

## Planned
- Reimplement upstream change to pass full extension objects through config/memory discovery instead of only context file paths, adjusting CLI, core, and a2a-server flows per `project-plans/20260104gmerge/cc7e1472-plan.md`.

## Reported
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/AUDIT.md` marks cc7e1472 as **SKIP / NO_OP**, asserting LLxprt already achieves equivalent functionality by filtering extensions before passing context file paths in a2a-server config rather than passing whole extensions into memory discovery.

## Actual (evidence)
- a2a-server builds `extensionContextFilePaths` from `extensions` and passes only those paths into `loadServerHierarchicalMemory` (not full extension objects). See `packages/a2a-server/src/config/config.ts:73`.
- CLI config similarly derives `extensionContextFilePaths` from active extensions and passes those paths into `loadHierarchicalLlxprtMemory`. See `packages/cli/src/config/config.ts:983`.
- Core memory discovery accepts `extensionContextFilePaths` and merely adds those paths to the set of memory files. See `packages/core/src/utils/memoryDiscovery.ts:243`.
- Core config still stores full extensions on the config object separately, but does not route them into memory discovery. See `packages/core/src/config/config.ts:179`.

## Gaps
- The upstream refactor to pass full extension objects into memory discovery (with filtering there) is not present; LLxprt continues to pass only context file paths. Functionality appears equivalent, but the architectural change itself is skipped.

## Confidence
- **Medium** — direct code inspection confirms current data flow; no runtime verification was performed for this audit.
