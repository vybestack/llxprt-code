# Batch 15 Audit

## Intent
- Refactor `EditTool.Name` to use centralized `EDIT_TOOL_NAME` constant (upstream `3a1d3769`).

## Claimed Action
- PROGRESS.md claims Batch 15 was PICKed and committed as `8d4830129` for the refactor.

## Code Evidence
- `EDIT_TOOL_NAME` is defined as the centralized tool name constant in `packages/core/src/tools/tool-names.ts:20`.
- `EditTool` uses the centralized constant for `Name` in `packages/core/src/tools/edit.ts:691`.
- `EditTool` imports `EDIT_TOOL_NAME` from `tool-names.ts` in `packages/core/src/tools/edit.ts:36`.

## Gaps/Mismatches
- No Batch 15 entry found in NOTES.md, and AUDIT.md table row for `3a1d3769` lacks status/local commit metadata. Evidence in code still shows the refactor is present.

## Verdict
real
