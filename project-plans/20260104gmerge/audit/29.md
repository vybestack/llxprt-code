# Batch 29 Audit

## Planned
- Upstream `23e52f0f` (Batch 29) refactors core tool name usage to centralize tool names and avoid circular dependencies for Edit/Grep/Read tools.

## Reported
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/PROGRESS.md` reports Batch 29 as REIMPLEMENTED via tool name alias additions in `tool-names.ts` (commit `fb8155a2b`).
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/AUDIT.md` lists `23e52f0f` as REIMPLEMENT + VERIFIED, stating tool name centralization already implemented.

## Actual (evidence)
- Centralized aliases exist in `packages/core/src/tools/tool-names.ts:20-23`, defining `EDIT_TOOL_NAME`, `GREP_TOOL_NAME`, `READ_MANY_FILES_TOOL_NAME`, and `READ_FILE_TOOL_NAME`.
- `EditTool` uses the centralized constant: `packages/core/src/tools/edit.ts:691` (`static readonly Name = EDIT_TOOL_NAME`).
- `GrepTool` still hardcodes the name: `packages/core/src/tools/grep.ts:895` (`static readonly Name = 'search_file_content'`).
- `ReadFileTool` still hardcodes the name: `packages/core/src/tools/read-file.ts:296` (`static readonly Name: string = 'read_file'`).

## Gaps
- The reported “centralization” is only partially applied: aliases exist, but Grep/Read tool classes do not consume `GREP_TOOL_NAME` or `READ_FILE_TOOL_NAME`. This does not fully meet upstream intent to centralize tool names for Edit/Grep/Read and avoid circular dependencies across those tools.

## Confidence
- Medium: Evidence confirms alias constants and EditTool usage, but Grep/Read still use literals, so functionality is only partially aligned with upstream intent.
