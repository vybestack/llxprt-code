# Batch 36 Audit — 995ae717

## Planned
- Reimplement upstream `995ae717` “refactor(logging): Centralize all console messaging to a shared logger (part 1)”.
- Scope touched: CLI/core logging paths, consolidating console messaging via a shared logger singleton.
- Full verification cadence (lint, typecheck, test, format, build, start).

## Reported
- Status in `AUDIT.md`: SKIP → NO_OP, rationale: LLxprt already has a superior centralized DebugLogger system; upstream singleton would be a regression.
- `PROGRESS.md` marks Batch 36 as SKIP with existing DebugLogger architecture.
- `NOTES.md` documents the skip and re-validation on 2026-01-06.

## Actual (Evidence)
- LLxprt already centralizes logging via `DebugLogger`, which handles namespaces, config-driven enablement, redaction, file output, and stderr routing. Evidence in `packages/core/src/debug/DebugLogger.ts:12` through `packages/core/src/debug/DebugLogger.ts:273`.
- Debug configuration is centralized and merged from env/user/project/CLI, enabling/disabling logging and output targets. Evidence in `packages/core/src/debug/ConfigurationManager.ts:11` through `packages/core/src/debug/ConfigurationManager.ts:236`.
- Console output is already consolidated/controlled in CLI via `ConsolePatcher` to route console messages to UI/debug streams. Evidence in `packages/cli/src/ui/utils/ConsolePatcher.ts:16` through `packages/cli/src/ui/utils/ConsolePatcher.ts:70`.

## Gaps
- No direct adoption of upstream’s shared-logger singleton; LLxprt’s existing DebugLogger system supersedes the upstream change.
- Upstream’s specific refactor of CLI console calls is not present as a 1:1 code change, but the same functional goal (centralized logging) is already met by the DebugLogger + ConsolePatcher architecture.

## Confidence
- High. The existing DebugLogger/ConfigurationManager/ConsolePatcher implementation provides centralized logging controls and output routing, making the upstream refactor redundant.
