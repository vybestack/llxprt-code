# Batch 48 Audit

## Planned
- Upstream `ce40a653` (Make compression threshold editable in the UI) scheduled as a PICK in `project-plans/20260104gmerge/PLAN.md` (Batch 48).

## Reported
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/AUDIT.md` lists `ce40a653` as **SKIP / NO_OP** with “Alternative Valid Architecture,” noting LLxprt’s object-based `model.chatCompression` API vs upstream’s `model.compressionThreshold` number.
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/PROGRESS.md` marks Batch 48 as “SKIP-NO_OP (alternative architecture: object-based vs number-based threshold).”

## Actual (evidence)
- LLxprt retains `chatCompression` as an object setting in the schema (`packages/cli/src/config/settingsSchema.ts:1142`), indicating the UI does not expose a numeric `compressionThreshold` field.
- Core configuration defines `ChatCompressionSettings` with `contextPercentageThreshold` (`packages/core/src/config/config.ts:128`), confirming the object-based API remains in use.
- Compression logic still reads `config.getChatCompression()?.contextPercentageThreshold` (`packages/core/src/core/client.ts:1741`), not a `getCompressionThreshold()` numeric value.

## Gaps
- Upstream’s UI-editable `model.compressionThreshold` number and related config API changes did not land.
- No evidence of a dedicated UI setting to edit compression threshold; LLxprt continues to rely on object-based `chatCompression` settings instead.

## Confidence
- High. The schema and core compression logic show the object-based configuration is intact, matching the reported SKIP/NO_OP decision.
