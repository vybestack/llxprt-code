# Batch 40 Audit (654c5550, 0658b4aa)

## Planned
- Cherry-pick upstream `654c5550` (add wasm read unit test).
- Cherry-pick upstream `0658b4aa` (deflake replace integration test).

## Reported
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/AUDIT.md` marks `654c5550` as **APPLIED** with a partial reimplementation note: a test was added but the production helper `readWasmBinaryFromDisk` does not exist in LLxprt.
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/AUDIT.md` marks `0658b4aa` as **APPLIED** with the note that the flaky “insert multi-line block” replace test was skipped.

## Actual (evidence)
- `packages/core/src/utils/fileUtils.test.ts:548` introduces a `describe('readWasmBinaryFromDisk')` block that dynamically imports `readWasmBinaryFromDisk` and asserts it loads a WASM fixture as a `Uint8Array`, confirming the test was added.
- `packages/core/src/utils/fileUtils.ts:1` contains no exported `readWasmBinaryFromDisk` implementation, indicating the test exists without a matching production helper.
- `integration-tests/replace.test.ts:186` shows `it.skip('should insert a multi-line block of text', ...)`, aligning with the deflaking change by skipping the previously flaky test.

## Gaps
- `654c5550`: The test expects `readWasmBinaryFromDisk`, but no implementation exists in `packages/core/src/utils/fileUtils.ts`, so the change is test-only and incomplete relative to upstream functionality.
- `0658b4aa`: No gaps found; the deflaking step is present as a skipped test, which matches the reported outcome.

## Confidence
- **Medium** — evidence is from direct code inspection of the test additions and missing implementation, without executing tests.
