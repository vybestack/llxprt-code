# Batch 04 Audit

## Intent
- Assess upstream `130f0a02` (remove legacy subagent code) and determine if it should be applied to LLxprt.

## Claimed Action
- SKIP upstream removal because LLxprt has an advanced, actively used subagent system (SubAgentScope) and removing files would break core functionality.

## Code Evidence
- `packages/core/src/core/subagent.ts:411` defines `SubAgentScope` and its factory (`create`) showing active subagent runtime infrastructure.
- `packages/core/src/core/subagentOrchestrator.ts:82` documents the orchestrator that launches `SubAgentScope` instances.
- `packages/cli/src/ui/commands/subagentCommand.ts:11` implements the CLI command wiring for subagent management.

## Gaps/Mismatches
- None found. The claimed skip is consistent with the presence of active subagent code in LLxprt.

## Verdict
- real
