# Batch 49 Audit

## Planned
- Batch 49 was planned as a **PICK** of upstream `b1bbef43`:
  - “Allow continue on prompt if LoopDetection disabled”
  - Plan row: `project-plans/20260104gmerge/PLAN.md:172`

## Reported
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/AUDIT.md` lists `b1bbef43` as **SKIP** with note: incompatible architecture (LLxprt LoopDetectionService lacks `disabledForSession` or `disableForSession()`).

## Actual (evidence)
- LLxprt loop detection appears to be implemented differently; the service exists at:
  - `packages/core/src/services/loopDetectionService.ts`
- Other audit evidence (Batch 43 report) references loop detection integration points:
  - `packages/cli/src/ui/hooks/useGeminiStream.ts`
  - `packages/core/src/core/client.ts`

## Gaps
- This report does not include direct evidence that LLxprt lacks the specific upstream API (`disabledForSession` / `disableForSession()`), though that is consistent with existing architecture notes.

## Confidence
- Medium. Reported SKIP reason is plausible and aligns with other batch audit evidence, but should be confirmed by inspecting `LoopDetectionService` API surface.
