# Batch 27 Audit

## Planned
- Batch 27 was planned as a **PICK** of upstream `d065c3ca`:
  - “Enable typechecking for more test files”
  - Plan row: `project-plans/20260104gmerge/PLAN.md:150`

## Reported
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/AUDIT.md` row for `d065c3ca` indicates **PICK** and **VERIFIED** with a note that it was effectively **NO_OP** in LLxprt (test files already typechecked).

## Actual (evidence)
- LLxprt’s TypeScript typecheck coverage for tests appears to already include additional files compared to upstream.
- The repo’s `AUDIT.md` notes an alternate type-safe approach (using `ReturnType<typeof vi.fn>` rather than imported Mock types) and that mandatory commands passed.

## Gaps
- No clear gap identified: this batch appears to be a NO_OP by virtue of LLxprt already meeting the intent.
- If we want higher certainty, verify by locating the upstream file list from `d065c3ca` and confirming those file paths are not excluded in LLxprt tsconfig(s).

## Confidence
- Medium-high. The AUDIT.md row explicitly states VERIFIED NO_OP with validation passing, but I did not independently reconstruct the upstream changed-file list.
