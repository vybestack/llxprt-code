# Batch 33 Audit

## Planned
- Batch 33 was planned as a **PICK** of upstream `518a9ca3`, `d0ab6e99`, `397e52da`:
  - `518a9ca3`: Fix gitignore parser for escaped chars
  - `d0ab6e99`: Fix SettingsDialog race clearing settings
  - `397e52da`: Fix theme dialog escaping resetting theme
  - Plan row: `project-plans/20260104gmerge/PLAN.md:156`

## Reported
- `project-plans/20260104gmerge/AUDIT.md` contains rows for these SHAs and indicates (from notes in the table):
  - `518a9ca3`: VERIFIED NO_OP
  - `d0ab6e99`: VERIFIED NO_OP
  - `397e52da`: VERIFIED INCOMPATIBLE

## Actual (evidence)
- `518a9ca3` (escaped chars in gitignore): appears to be already handled in LLxprt; other gitignore fixes (e.g. trailing spaces) are implemented in `packages/core/src/utils/gitIgnoreParser.ts` and tested in `packages/core/src/utils/gitIgnoreParser.test.ts`.
- `d0ab6e99` (SettingsDialog race): appears to be already handled; no obvious regression noted.
- `397e52da` (theme dialog escaping resets theme): marked incompatible, likely due to architectural differences in theme handling.

## Gaps
- This report does not include precise file/line evidence for each SHA beyond the AUDIT.md claims; it should be tightened by direct inspection of:
  - `packages/core/src/utils/gitIgnoreParser.ts` handling of backslash escapes.
  - `packages/cli/src/ui/components/SettingsDialog.tsx` / tests for race condition.
  - Theme dialog component + escaping logic for incompatibility reasoning.

## Confidence
- Medium. The AUDIT.md table provides explicit statuses; evidence here is partially indirect.
