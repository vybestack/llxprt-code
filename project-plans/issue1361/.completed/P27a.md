## Summary

The old SessionPersistenceService system has been completely removed. No references to `SessionPersistenceService`, `ChatRecordingService`, `PersistedSession`, `PersistedUIHistoryItem`, or `PersistedToolCall` remain anywhere in the codebase. The old implementation and test files have been deleted. The new recording system (verified in P26a) is the sole session persistence mechanism. All verification gates pass cleanly.
