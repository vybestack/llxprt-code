Completed: 2026-02-13 15:22
Files Created:
- packages/core/src/recording/RecordingIntegration.ts
Files Modified:
- packages/core/src/recording/RecordingIntegration.test.ts (Phase-13 TDD fixes only to restore intended suites)
- packages/core/src/recording/index.ts
Tests Added: 43 (in RecordingIntegration.test.ts)
Verification:
- npm run typecheck: PASS
- cd packages/core && npx vitest run src/recording/RecordingIntegration.test.ts: PASS (43/43)
- Property-based tests: 13/43 (30.2%)
- No mock theater patterns in RecordingIntegration.test.ts (grep clean)
- No reverse testing patterns in RecordingIntegration.test.ts (grep clean)
- Deferred implementation detection on RecordingIntegration.ts: no matches for TODO/FIXME/HACK/STUB/placeholder/empty-return patterns
Notes:
- Phase 14 implementation stayed in core recording scope: RecordingIntegration event wiring/delegates/flush/dispose/replacement.
- No HistoryService/geminiChat/nonInteractive wiring was performed in this phase boundary; those integration points remain for later phases.
