Phase: P01a
Plan: PLAN-20260216-HOOKSYSTEMREWRITE
Status: COMPLETED
Started: 2026-02-16
Completed: 2026-02-16
Files Created: none
Files Modified:
- project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/.completed/P01a.md
- project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/execution-tracker.md
Tests Added: none
Verification Commands Run:
- grep -q "^Status: COMPLETED$" project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/.completed/P01.md
- test -f project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/analysis/domain-model.md
- rg "HookSystem|HookEventHandler|coreToolScheduler|geminiChat|scope" project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/analysis/domain-model.md
Verification Output Summary:
- P01 completion marker present and valid.
- analysis/domain-model.md exists and contains required verification anchors.
- Semantic checklist passes: requirement clusters covered, caller/scope boundaries explicit, error/fail-open invariants captured.
Holistic Functionality Assessment:
- What was implemented: Verified P01 analysis artifact against phase verification contract.
- Requirement behavior coverage: Domain model supports requirement clusters and integration boundaries.
- End-to-end data flow traced: HookSystem to caller boundary flow is represented in analysis artifact.
- Edge cases validated: Fail-open/error invariants represented in analysis model and verification evidence.
- Verdict: P01a complete.
