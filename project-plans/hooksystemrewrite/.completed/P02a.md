Phase: P02a
Plan: PLAN-20260216-HOOKSYSTEMREWRITE
Status: COMPLETED
Started: 2026-02-16
Completed: 2026-02-16
Files Created: (none)
Files Modified: project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/.completed/P02a.md; project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/execution-tracker.md
Tests Added: (none)
Verification Commands Run:
- grep -q "^Status: COMPLETED$" project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/.completed/P02.md
- for file in project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/analysis/pseudocode/*.md; do rg "^[0-9]+:" "$file"; done
- rg "Interface Contracts|Integration Points|Anti-Pattern Warnings" project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/analysis/pseudocode/*.md
Verification Output Summary:
- Prerequisite check passed: P02 marker is COMPLETED.
- All pseudocode files emitted numbered integration lines via rg "^[0-9]+:".
- All pseudocode files contain Interface Contracts, Integration Points (Line-by-Line), and Anti-Pattern Warnings headings.
Holistic Functionality Assessment:
- What was implemented: Phase 02a verification executed exactly per plan and reconciled in marker/tracker.
- Requirement behavior coverage: Verification confirms contract-first pseudocode structure and boundary/failure semantic scaffolding across all pseudocode docs.
- End-to-end data flow traced: Lifecycle, event handler flow, tool pipeline, model pipeline, aggregation/chaining, and resilience/timeout compatibility pseudocode files all validated by command evidence.
- Edge cases validated: Structural anti-pattern warning sections are present in every pseudocode file; prerequisite gating enforced via P02 completion check.
- Verdict: PASS
