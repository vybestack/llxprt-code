Tests Added: none
Verification Commands Run:
- test -f project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/analysis/domain-model.md
- rg "Contexts|Core Entities|State Model|Invariants|Edge Cases|Error Scenarios" project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/analysis/domain-model.md
Verification Output Summary:
- analysis/domain-model.md exists.
- Required section anchors present: Contexts, Core Entities, State Model, Invariants, Edge Cases, Error Scenarios.
Holistic Functionality Assessment:
- What was implemented: Validated and retained P01 analysis artifact structure/content anchors per phase spec.
- Requirement behavior coverage: Includes runtime boundaries, entities, state transitions, invariants, in/out-of-scope behavior, edge cases, and error scenarios.
- End-to-end data flow traced: Event fired -> plan -> execution -> aggregation -> caller application semantics documented.
- Edge cases validated: Exit code 2 handling, double-encoded JSON, invalid regex fallback, timeout/signal fail-open, streaming interruption.
- Verdict: P01 complete.
