Files Created: none
Files Modified:
- project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/.completed/P00.md
- project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/execution-tracker.md
Tests Added: none
Verification Commands Run: none (P00 scope is overview/preflight setup metadata only; no P00a verification executed)
Verification Output Summary: N/A for P00-only metadata completion.
Holistic Functionality Assessment:
- What was implemented: Recorded Phase 00 completion metadata and reconciled tracker/marker status for P00 only.
- Requirement behavior coverage: P00 prerequisite established by confirming overview artifact and setting authoritative completion marker.
- End-to-end data flow traced: N/A (no runtime/code-path changes in P00).
- Edge cases validated: N/A (no behavioral implementation in P00).
- Verdict: P00 complete; prerequisite status now unblocks P00a execution.
