Verification Output Summary:
All P04a verification commands pass. 7 TDD tests from P04 are all passing. Config.getHookSystem() correctly returns HookSystem when enableHooks=true and undefined when enableHooks=false.
Holistic Functionality Assessment:
- What was implemented: (P04 TDD tests verified)
- Requirement behavior coverage: All HOOK-001,002,003,004,010 tests pass
- End-to-end data flow traced: Config → getHookSystem → HookSystem/undefined
- Edge cases validated: Default false, tools.enableHooks no-op, idempotent initialize
- Verdict: PASS - All P04 TDD verification complete
