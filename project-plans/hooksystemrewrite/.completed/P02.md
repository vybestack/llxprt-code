Files Created: none
Files Modified:
- project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/.completed/P02.md
- project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/execution-tracker.md
Tests Added: none
Verification Commands Run:
- grep -q "^Status: COMPLETED$" project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/.completed/P01a.md
- ls -la project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/analysis/pseudocode
- rg "^[0-9]+:" project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/analysis/pseudocode/*.md
- rg "Interface Contracts|Integration Points|Anti-Pattern Warnings" project-plans/hooksystemrewrite/analysis/pseudocode/*.md
Verification Output Summary:
- Prerequisite marker validated: P01a is COMPLETED.
- Pseudocode directory contains required phase artifacts for lifecycle, handler flow, tool/model pipelines, aggregation, and resilience.
- Numbered contract-first pseudocode present across all artifacts.
- Required sections present across all artifacts: Interface Contracts, Integration Points, Anti-Pattern Warnings.
Holistic Functionality Assessment:
- What was implemented: Phase pseudocode artifact verification and completion reconciliation.
- Requirement behavior coverage: Contract-first behavioral flows are represented for all required subsystem areas.
- End-to-end data flow traced: Lifecycle to handler to execution/aggregation pipeline flow is captured in numbered pseudocode.
- Edge cases validated: Blocking decisions, sequential vs parallel execution, timeout/signal fail-open behavior documented.
- Verdict: P02 complete.
