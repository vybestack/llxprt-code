| 3 | Read methods (`getKey`, `listKeys`, `hasKey`) throw `NotYetImplemented` | [OK] PASS |
| 4 | Write methods (`saveKey`, `deleteKey`) throw with "Read-only" message (not NotYetImplemented) | [OK] PASS |
| 5 | Plan marker `@plan PLAN-20250214-CREDPROXY.P12` present | [OK] PASS |
| 6 | `npm run typecheck` passes | [OK] PASS |
| 7 | Matches pseudocode `004-proxy-provider-key-storage.md` | [OK] PASS |

## Notes

- Write method error messages use "Read-only: key storage is not writable from sandbox" which is
  a reasonable stub variant of the pseudocode's "API key management is not available in sandbox mode.
  Manage keys on the host." — the final wording will be aligned when the real implementation lands.
- All 5 methods have correct TypeScript signatures matching the pseudocode contract.
- The `ProxySocketClient` is received via constructor injection (shared instance pattern), not
  created internally.
