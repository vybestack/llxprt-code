# P28 PASS

Phase 28 execution completed for `PLAN-20250214-CREDPROXY.P28`.

- Added behavioral TDD coverage file for `ProxyOAuthAdapter` with plan marker and requirement/scenario annotations.
- Added transport-boundary socket client double (no mock theater assertions).
- Added fake-timer polling behavior tests.
- Verification run results captured (typecheck + focused test run).

## Notes
- Current adapter implementation is still phase-27 stub (`NotYetImplemented`), so behavioral tests fail naturally as expected for TDD red phase.
- Typecheck currently reports shape mismatches between test payload keys and stub `InitiateResponse` type.
