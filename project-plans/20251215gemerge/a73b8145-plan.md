# Implementation Plan: a73b8145 - Rename expect Methods

## STATUS: SKIPPED

**This commit is SKIPPED - incorporated into 5dc7059b implementation.**

## Summary of Upstream Changes

Upstream commit `a73b8145` ("Rename expect methods. (#11046)"):
- Renames `waitForText` → `expectText`
- Renames `waitForExit` → `expectExit`

**Depends on:** 5dc7059b (InteractiveRun class)

## Why SKIPPED

This commit is a simple rename that occurred after 5dc7059b in gemini-cli's development history. However, since:

1. **LLxprt hasn't implemented 5dc7059b yet** - The InteractiveRun class doesn't exist in our codebase
2. **No existing code uses the old names** - We're not migrating from waitFor* to expect*
3. **We can avoid unnecessary churn** - There's no reason to implement with old names then rename

**Solution:** Implement 5dc7059b with the FINAL method names (`expectText`/`expectExit`) from the start.

## Implementation Approach

This commit's changes are **incorporated directly into plan 5dc7059b**.

The 5dc7059b plan has been updated to:
- Use `expectText()` instead of `waitForText()`
- Use `expectExit()` instead of `waitForExit()`
- Document that this incorporates a73b8145

## Result

When 5dc7059b is complete:
- ✅ InteractiveRun class exists
- ✅ Methods are named expectText/expectExit (final names)
- ✅ No rename needed
- ✅ Same final state as applying both commits sequentially

## Verification

After implementing 5dc7059b, verify:

```bash
# Should find expectText (not waitForText)
grep -r "expectText" integration-tests/test-helper.ts

# Should find expectExit (not waitForExit)
grep -r "expectExit" integration-tests/test-helper.ts

# Should NOT find old names
grep -r "waitForText\|waitForExit" integration-tests/
# Expected: No matches (or only in comments/documentation)
```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] 5dc7059b plan updated to use expect* names
- [x] This plan marked as SKIPPED
- [ ] 5dc7059b implemented with final names
- [ ] Verification confirms no waitFor* method names in code
