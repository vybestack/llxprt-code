# Implementation Plan: 49b66733 - Disable CTRL-C Test

## Summary of Upstream Changes

Upstream commit `49b66733` ("fix(infra) - Disable CTRL-C test (#11122)"):
- Changed `describe('Ctrl+C exit', ...)` to `describe.skip('Ctrl+C exit', ...)`
- Unconditionally disables the entire test suite (not just in CI)
- No explanatory comment added in the upstream change

## Current State in LLxprt

LLxprt currently uses **conditional skipping** for CI environments only:
```typescript
// Skip interactive PTY tests in CI - they require a real terminal and are inherently flaky
describe.skipIf(process.env.CI === 'true')('Ctrl+C exit', () => {
```

This means:
- Test is **skipped in CI** (where it's flaky)
- Test **runs locally** (where it may work better with real terminals)

## Implementation Decision

**NOP (No Operation)** - LLxprt's current approach is superior to upstream:

**Rationale:**
1. **LLxprt already prevents CI failures** via `skipIf(process.env.CI === 'true')`
2. **LLxprt preserves local testing capability** for developers with real terminals
3. **LLxprt has a clear rationale comment** explaining why the skip is needed
4. **Upstream uses blanket skip** which eliminates all test coverage everywhere
5. **PTY tests are inherently CI-hostile** but can work locally with proper terminal emulation

**Upstream approach (describe.skip):**
- Disables test unconditionally in all environments
- Loses test coverage completely
- No documentation of why

**LLxprt approach (skipIf CI):**
- Maintains test coverage in local development
- Prevents CI flakiness
- Well-documented with clear comment

## Files to Modify

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| None | No changes needed - current implementation is optimal |

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Test doesn't cause CI failures (already satisfied via skipIf)
- [x] Has rationale comment (already present)
- [x] Preserves local test coverage where possible (LLxprt advantage)
