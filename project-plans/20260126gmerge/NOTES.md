## Running Notes

### Planning Phase (2026-01-26)

- Created branch `20260126gmerge` from main
- Fetched upstream tags
- Analyzed 33 commits in v0.13.0..v0.14.0 range
- Research findings:
  - LLxprt UI scrolling is MORE advanced than upstream (batching, drag-drop)
  - Quota handling architecture completely different (errorParsing.ts vs useQuotaAndFallback.ts)
  - ModelConfigService incompatible with multi-provider
  - One test needs reimplementation (list_directory flaky fix)
